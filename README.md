An API built for a social network web application that uses a NoSQL database. This allows websites to handle large amounts of unstructured data. Once you enter the command to invoke start the application, your server starts and Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDb database. You will then be able to create users, create and delete thoughts and reactions, as well as add and remove friends from a users friend list.
